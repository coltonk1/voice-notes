### Conclusion

This project was fun to make in one semester! We have stopped working on the app, and as a result there are some issues. Some known problems:

-   No way to delete posts or account.
-   Style isnt fully uniform.
-   Not very much button feedback (ex. when creating a post you need to refresh to see the new post).
-   Very rarely, posts will not load for some reason.
